Dear reader,

The hospitalization data files exceed 100MB and therefore cannot be hosted on GitHub.  
To reproduce this part of the project, please contact the author via email.

To reproduce the process described in the Script.R file, first extract all the hosp_file folders. Then, use the Tabwin software (available in the compressed Tabwin.zip folder) to convert the .dbc files into .dbf format.
